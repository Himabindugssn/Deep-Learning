# MP Neuron model
This has been implemented on breast cancer dataset available in sklearn.
Data :binary (0,1) {hence binarise the data}
Task :binary classification {0/1 i.e. benign / malignant in this particular dataset}
Model:straight line separating 0's and 1's. Slope can't be changed. Only intercepts {i.e.b }
Loss function:(y-yi)^2 {y-actual ; yi - predicted}
Learning algorithm: there is no learning algorithm as such. Brute force- search has to be done.
Evaluation: no. of correct predictions/total no. of predictions.
MP Neuron Class hasn't been used in this...
